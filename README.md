**gPhoton** is a project to calibrate, archive, and make available every photon event observed by the GALEX mission in an effort to dramatically improve the flexibility and utility of the data with specific emphasis on enabling short time domain photometric studies.

To get started, please read the [User Guide](https://github.com/cmillion/gPhoton/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md).

The database is still being populated with GALEX data. It currently contains ~5% of the GR6/7 corpus. The tile-by-tile coverage of the current database can be found [here]() and [here](). Future database updates will be by sky region, which the next one expected to cover all data from above 52.5 degrees in declination.
